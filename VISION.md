# Vision
My desire for this platform is first **transparency**.  I want this to be a place where *new/junior developers* can come in and look at the code if the platform and clearly see everything that is going on.  This means, many comments, thorough documentation and helpful guides to understand the code and concepts being used within it.

- In terms of technology, I am not picky.  If we develop one and it doesn't work or we want to develop a different stack, I am perfectly fine with that.  Everything we do on here should be a learning experience and if we document and explain it properly, we will help ourselves and many others who are looking to learn.


## Initial Ideas

### Stack (MERN):
- MongoDB
- Expressjs
- Reactjs
- Node.js

I have uploaded an example backend for reference.  This doesn't have to be the answer, especially if nobody knows how to use the technologies or wants to build it with a different stack.  Remember, the team leader has the final say.  As the team leader of the overall Platform team, I am fine with whatever technology the back-end team decides.  We can make further adjustments down the road.


### User Interface
I was thinking of a Trello looking interface where each card is a team that includes all the details of that team:
- Team Leader
- Stack
- Members (With timezone)
- Slack Channel/Workspace
- Discord Channel/Server
- Design/Code methodology
- Any other Project or Team specific information

The cards can be in columns related to their activity
- Initial Idea
- Waiting for team members
- Active (Building)
- Inactive (Not building): Team leader selected
- Paused (Paused for a certain time period)
- Depreciated (Projects that haven't been worked on in a long time): Algorithmically selected
- Archive (Projects that we want to keep for good reference)


### Task Management
- I would like to keep all tasks as issues within the Github platform and to make them as easy as possible so beginners can help on very simple things and learn.

## Pace
- I do not plan for this to be a fast project, just building the platform is a team and learning experience of it's own.
- I do not want people to be stressed out or weighed down from other things in their lives, feeling like they have to commit.
- This should be freely worked upon as much or as little as you desire.


## Reminders
- Please remember, this is a platform to learn and that goes for everyone involved.  If you are a team leader, how to lead.  If you are a team member, how to follow and contribute.  
- The projects, including this one are all up to the team leader and members.  
- You will learn what works and what doesn't in a team or on a project as well as with certain technologies
- Don't be afraid to step out and make a decision, you have the freedom to do so and grow as much as you are able.
